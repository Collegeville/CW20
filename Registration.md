## Registration

### Workshop Registration

We have a single form for workshop registration and (optional) on-campus housing reservations.  The workshop registration fee is $150. The fee covers facility and media fees and morning and afternoon snacks.  Meals are at the university cafeteria and paid for separately. Housing options are described below.

Please register by June 21, 2020. [**Registration Form**](https://www.csbsju.edu/forms/8D6H22T02P)

#### Cancellation

If you are unable to attend the workshop, please cancel by July 6 for a full refund.

### Housing

During the summer months, student apartments and dorms are available for visitors.  While not a traditional hotel setting, the rooms are clean, affordable and within reasonable walking distance to the meeting room.  More traditional hotel arrangements are possible (see below).

#### Available rooms are:

- **Single room, Placid Apartments, air conditioned with bath ($55/night):** Each Placid apartment has six private bedrooms with private bathrooms.  There is a shared kitchen and laundry room.  Picking this option gives you your own small hotel-like room with Internet, sink and shower that is reached by entering the apartment and climbing stairs to your own room.  **This option requires the ability to use stairs.**
- **Single room, Benet Hall air conditioned with bath ($55/night):** The Benet Hall rooms are more traditional college dorms with private baths.  These rooms are very close to the workshop meeting room and are handicap accessible.
- **Single room, Flynn Town Apartments, 2 person apartment with individual bath ($45/night):** Flynn Town apartments come with a private room and a separate bathroom.  This option would be most appealing to attendees who want to coordinate accommodations with one other person or a family.  Flynn Town is about a 5-minute walk to the workshop meeting room.

### Meals

St. John's Refectory provides a one-price buffet with salad bar and a variety of entrees and desserts.  Meals can be purchased at the cashier desk.  An 8-meal packet of punches is also an option, with a reduced per-meal cost.

### St. John's Abbey Guesthouse

St. John's University is located on the grounds of St. John's Abbey.  The Abbey has a guesthouse that is available for visitors and is within easy walking distance to the workshop room.  Someone who wants a more hotel-like experience on campus can check availability for rooms in the guesthouse: [https://www.abbeyguesthouse.org](https://www.abbeyguesthouse.org). The guesthouse is not a primary workshop housing option, but may be a good idea for someone with special circumstances.

### Off-Campus Accommodations

St. John's is about 15 miles west of St. Cloud, MN.  If you prefer a more standard hotel arrangement, there are many hotels in the St. Cloud area, less than 30 minutes from campus by car.
