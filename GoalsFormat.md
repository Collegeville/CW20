## Workshop Goals and Format

![](assets/CollegevilleWorkshopOverview.pdf)

### Goals

The goal of this workshop is to bring together community leaders and practitioners in scientific software for the purpose of identifying the challenges and priority research direction for improving developer productivity for scientific software.  We want to explore, characterize and articulate scientific software practices from industry, research labs and academia, and identify common requirements and essential differences in these communities.

Through white papers, recorded presentations and live Q&A sessions and group descussions, we hope to build a body of shared experience and artifacts for the scientific community. We anticipate that the diverse experience of the workshop attendees will lead to a deeper awareness and understanding of how the represented communities can benefit from collaboration, coordination and complementarity.

### Format

Due to the pandemic, Collegeville 2020 will be an entirely virtual event.  As the diagram above shows, we are soliciting white papers, posters and teatime themes contributions from the community.  From these contributions we will build the detailed program.  Details for submitting are on the [Contribute](Contribute.md) page.
