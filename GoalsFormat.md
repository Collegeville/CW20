## Workshop Goals and Format

### Goals

The goal of this workshop is to bring together community leaders and practitioners in scientific software for the purpose of identifying the challenges and priority research direction for improving developer productivity for scientific software.  We want to explore, characterize and articulate scientific software practices from industry, research labs and academia and identify common requirements and essential differences in these communities.

We will write a workshop report to describe our findings and articulate research priorities that will advance the developer productivity for scientific software, especially toward better usability across industry, lab and academic institutions. We anticipate that the diverse experience of the workshop attendees will lead to a deeper awareness and understanding of how the represented communities can benefit from collaboration, coordination and complementarity.

### Format

We will start and end the workshop with informal social sessions intended to foster communication and interactions among attendees, especially for the purpose of understanding commonalities and differences across the diverse communities represented by attendees.  Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday will include plenary sessions.  The first day will focus on challenges to improving developer productivity; the second and third days on potential strategies for improvement. For a full workshop experience, please plan to participate in the 7 pm evening informal discussions each day.
