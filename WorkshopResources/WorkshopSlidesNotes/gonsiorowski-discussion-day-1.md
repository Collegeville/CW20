## Short-term vs long-term productivity

-   good to have some people focused on each aspect
-   short-term results, while important, you need to keep an eye out for the long term.

## Productivity intersection with utility?

-   productivity: how much effort does it take to achieve your goal?
    -   goals are always evolving, each person has different goals
    -   problem comes when goals are in conflict

## how can you tell if productivity is improving over time?

-   hard to normalize wrt to different goals
-   how do individuals measure productivity?
    -   is self assessment (without quantification) enough?
-   frustration / emotional state is a big indicator about productivity

## what if the work you do one week is 'trown away' the next week?

-   teams need to learn from the macro failure of 'wasted' effort
-   as long as an individual learns during the process, maybe
-   Is the "wasted" work the only way you could have reached the conclusion that this was the wrong approach?
    -   how can we reduce the "wasted" effort next time around?
-   is there a de-brief that not only looks at what lead to the failure, but then *communicates* this to others

## individual productivity vs management-level productivity

## Efficiency == quality? or just getting-things-done?

-   you know it when you see it
-   inefficient -> duplication of effort
-   matching individual skills to the right problems
    -   resources aligned to the problem

## how to convince an individual to contribute to the wider team?

-   example: how to get the team to write documentation?
    -   one person would start writing the documentation, then hand it off to a second person to take it over and own it.
    -   useful to build documentation with other people
    -   paired programming / paired documentation
-   interpersonal challenge, both people need to get credit for the end result, both the documenter and the 'original coder'
-   what are the incentive structures at the management level? can you change those to the get the behavior that you want?
-   project manager & system engineer roles with opposite incentives.
    -   project manager: deliver on time
    -   system engineer: deliver a quality product
    -   in DOE, these *roles* might be handled by the same person. maybe it should be more explicit, so that people can think clearly about what needs to be done.

## Play to peoples strengths

-   customer interaction vs technical writing
-   align with what people like to do

## experience: code reviews have lead to some real quality improvements

-   are tools helping you, or getting in the way?

## balance finding the tools that are more useful, but not wanting to learn new things *all* the time

-   wait for the community to reach critical mass on a tool before personally investing in it
-   good news for tool developers, keep running sessions and getting the word out

## experience: what if management is imposing a tool for everyone?

-   it may depend on the type of tool that management
-   forced to use a macbook
-   management can make tools available: atlassian suite, make it easier to use
    -   need 'fresh blood' people who know whats out there, and can bring it in to the internal work

## q3: what can we make progress in the next year?

-   CI testing
    -   getting teams used to using that
    -   making it easier to learn / documentation
    -   how long can you use the resources?
    -   which tests exercise the code that was changed?
    -   and this needs to be automated, not chosen by a human
-   spack for system administrators
-   CI with spack does has some technical challenges
-   tools that are otherwise available, working on HPC systems
    -   identify where the gap is small, but the benefit would be large

## q4: prerequisites to addressing long-term challenges?

-   recognize the problems
-   have good community education in place
-   can we do requirements gathering, before jumping in to technical solutions, esp. if we are solving a problem as a community and each side has their tool to evangelize
-   requirements gathering is a super import part of the process
-   common file format? each lab had a different experience, but then had vastly different requirements
    -   have an objective 3rd party to bring everyone to the table and find the common ground
    -   3rd party owning the result, not any one lab
    -   community branding, not just any individual lab
    -   allow people doing the work the ability to collaborate, without the branding discussion
