### General Guidance
We welcome your contributed recording to the workshop.  Here are a few general guidelines:
- Talks, discussions and interviews will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube: Your participation in the event signifies your consent to being recorded.
- Brevity is valued: Focus on the key ideas. Viewers can reach out to you via Slack for follow up.
- Keep all discussion positive and respectful:  We are building a community of people with the common interest of improving scientific software through better developer productivity.

### Recorded Presentation Guidance
A recorded presentation involves a single speaker (or multiple speakers in sequence) delivering a talk aided by slides. Instructions:

- We are hoping to have all presentations recorded by Wednesday, July 15.
