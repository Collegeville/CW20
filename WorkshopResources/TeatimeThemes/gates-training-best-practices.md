*A teatime discussion theme for the
[2020 Collegeville Workshop on Scientific Software](https://collegeville.github.io/CW20/),
focussing on Developer Productivity.*

In the ever-changing landscape that is the scientific software domain,
continual learning on the job is just a fact of life.  We've all taken our fair
share of trainings, though, and they fall somewhere on the spectrum between
entirely forgettable and completely life-changing.  What is it that makes for
good training that will stick with you through the years and influence the way
you work on a daily basis?  As we bring new people on board, or bring folks up
to speed with new ideas, what are some best practices for learner engagement
that ultimately lead to increased developer productivity?  How does this
particular training context differ from more traditional learning environments?

In this teatime discussion, we'd like to
1. encourage sharing from those involved in training efforts&mdash;what's
   worked well, what's flopped, what're you considering for next time,
1. synthesize our collective wisdom from our disparate backgrounds into a set
   of recommendations to share, and
1. have everyone leave with something concrete to try implementing the next
   time you're leading a training effort.
