# Developing Software Sustainability and Productivity through BSSw.io


*Rinku Gupta, Lois McInnes Curfman - Argonne National Laboratory*

In the proposed teatime session, we hope to discuss with like-minded people on how to use as well as contribute to BSSw as a resource for advancing productivity and software sustainability within the CSE community. The BSSw.io website serves as a central hub for sharing information on practices, techniques, experiences, and tools to improve developer productivity and software sustainability. The goals of the site are to raise awareness of (1) the importance of good software practices to scientific productivity and to the quality and reliability of scientific results and (2) the increasing challenges facing CSE software developers as high-end computing heads to extreme scales. 

Since BSSw.io is created for the community, we want to solicit CSE community involvement for this resource. We hope that people can share their experiences as well as speak about their perspectives on the site.  Our main objective is to encourage an open discussion with the  community members to understand their needs, challenges and potential roadblocks for software sustainability/productivity and determine the nature of BSSw resources that can help alleviate this pain.
