# What Black Lives Matter has to do with Scientific Software Productivity:

## Starting a conversation about ethnicity, inclusion and scientific software productivity

[2020 Collegeville Workshop on Scientific Software](https://collegeville.github.io/CW20/) Developer Productivity Teatime Submission.

[Mark C. Miller (LLNL)](https://github.com/markcmiller86)

This virtual Tea(m) Time will be the *beginning* of a conversation about how
inclusion in HPC/CSE, and specifically racial/ethnic inclusion, impacts
scientific software productivity.

Given the recent protests and racial awakening in the country, I think many
of us have been asking ourselves what we can do to help address ethnic and
inclusivity inequities in our projects and organizations. I myself have been
wanting to know how I can be more proactive, instead of passive, about
helping my professional community address this issue and make forward progress.

Inclusion takes many forms with various focal points including race, gender,
gender-identity, LGBTQIA, religion and age to name a few. Furthermore, we are
affected by issues in these areas in *all* aspects of our lives, not just those
aspects having to do within our professional community as scientific software
developers.

Because race and ethnicity are rarely, if ever, discussed within the context
of scientific software development or even the broader institutional cultures
in which that work goes on, conversations on these topics can be challenging,
uncomfortable and even painful. This is something for which great care,
respect and understanding are needed to handle properly.

To partially address the above concerns, and as naïve as this may sound, this
Tea(m) Time proposes to focus mostly on *ethnic* inclusion and mostly on its
impact and role within the context of *scientific software productivity*.
Although the proposed scope is narrowly focused, admittedly artificially so,
we all may be very surprised to learn just how deep and nuanced this topic
winds up being even within this narrow scope.

In all likelihood, any one of the participants will be more informed on the
issues than me, the organizer. So, my hope is to simply help to start a
discussion and to serve as a moderator but to otherwise encourage dialogue
and discussion from other participants and to capture key take-aways.

To help set the stage and stimulate discussion, participants are asked to
consider reviewing at least *three* of the resources listed below prior to
attending the Tea(m) Time and then come ready and willing to listen and
share.
