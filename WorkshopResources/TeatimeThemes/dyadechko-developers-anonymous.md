The days when a software product was developed solo are long gone.
Software engineering is a collaborative effort;
dealing with people is a big part of our job,
and frequently it is the hardest one.

Everybody is welcome to join us over a cup of tea
and vent about the big and little human problems
that
eat your lunch,
toll individual and team productivity,
or waste project resources.

The chances are that your problem is not unique
and somebody else can offer a good solution.
Or a sincere compassion.

This may also be an opportunity for managers and developers
to learn about past mistakes
that would never be brought up otherwise.
