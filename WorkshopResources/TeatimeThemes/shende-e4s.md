Building applications by composing existing libraries and using existing tools can be a tremendous productivity improvement. If existing software is high quality, accessible and reusable, one would be much better off using it than writing your own. At the same time, as HPC and AI/ML software gets more complex, it is getting harder to maintain, install, and optimize tools and libraries correctly in an integrated and interoperable software stack. 

The Extreme-scale Scientific Software Stack (E4S) project aims to tame both the complexity and portability problems by creating an ecosystem of numerical libraries, runtime systems, and tools that lowers the barrier for entry for the HPC and AI/ML developer communities. E4S is a community effort to provide open source software packages grouped in SDKs for developing, deploying, and running scientific applications on HPC platforms. It aims to deliver a modular, interoperable, and deployable software stack based on the Spack package manager. E4S provides both source builds for native, bare-metal installations, as well as containers of a broad collection of software packages for secure, reproducible, container-based deployments. E4S exists to accelerate the development, deployment, and use of HPC software, lowering the barriers for HPC developers and users. 

In this teatime, we will discuss SDKs, the goals of the E4S project, and a new DocPortal that aggregates and summarizes documentation and metadata by raking Software Technology (ST) product repositories to provide a single online location for accurate product descriptions for ECP ST products.
