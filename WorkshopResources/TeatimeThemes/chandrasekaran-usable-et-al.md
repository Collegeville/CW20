# Usable, reusable, portable, maintainable, reproducible: How?

*Teatime theme - Collegeville 2020*

*Sunita Chandrasekaran - University of Delaware*

In this tea time session, we propose to discuss how to make progress on the many important attributes of high quality scientific software.  Of particular interest are:

1. Programming framework and options:
  - Modular frameworks,
  - Prior knowledge of the domain science,
  - Maintainability, portability, reusability, usability,
  - Challenges with migration of code from one platform to the other, what do we need here? Re-programming is not an option!
  - Language evolution to support heterogeneous systems and specialized systems

1. Reproducible software:
  - Consider reproducibility with aspects of open science as a whole.
  - What do we want to achieve, what are the known ways and challenges to get there?
  - Can we achieve standardization of reproducible software?

1. Lasting and maintainable:
  - Make it a reality.
  - Including constant modernization, culture, contributions, leadership/governance.
